<p align="center"> Hii I'm Cassy <3 I'm a female and go by she/her but I honestly don't care what pronouns you use for me, or what gender you see me as LOL

<p align="center"> I have ADHD, sensory autism, and depression. I also suck really bad at getting certain things done if I'm not interested in it. I also tend to get "mothered" by most people IRL, since I come off as shy and timid O.O

<p align="center"> I don't mind making new friends, it's just that I'm terribly bad at making conversations and extremely shy, if we share the same interests I'm more likely to yap more! If you're by any means uncomfortable, or just don't seem like we aren't a good fit to be friends, then you're always welcome to hide/block/etc me! I would want you to do whatever you feel comfortable, even if we are strangers <3

<p align="center"> I LOVEEE cuddles I'm a cuddle bug >.O I would love to have anyone c+h me freely even if on rare occasions I have DNI, DNIUF, etc in my name. I'll also cuddle anyone that allows c+h :3 if I cuddled you at least once, then I'm more likely to come to you to cuddle than going to other people <3
